# Decentraland websites

- Landing: https://decentraland.org
- World Viewer: https://decentraland.org/app/
- Builder: https://decentraland.org/builder

### Landing

To build the main landing you need to build it first. In development run:

```
npm start
```

and for a production build, run:

```
npm run build
```

You'll need to serve the `/dist` folder which will contain the compiled files.
